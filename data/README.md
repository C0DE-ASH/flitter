#### VAST Challenges 2009 (Dracorex) - Background
There are problems at the U.S. Embassy in Flovania, a small land-locked country
situated between the nations of Trium to the north and east, Posana to the 
west, and the Republic of Transak to the southwest.

The network security team recently found irregularities while reviewing Embassy
network traffic logs.  Finding no security issues that could explain the 
anomalies, they notified the Embassy Counterintelligence Officer.  Upon further 
investigation, the CI officer identified certain espionage “red flags”.  You 
have been requested to help him with the investigation.  

The 60 Embassy employees have 24x7 access to the facility, with access to the 
classified information room.  Attached you’ll find the following datasets:

1.  M1 - Badge and Computer Network Traffic
2.  M2 - Social Network and Geospatial

These datasets may help identify possible suspects, accomplices and evidence 
that could help the CI Office with their investigation.

For each of these datasets (i.e. for each of the mini challenge) you are asked 
to answer specific questions that can be deduced strictly from the data provided.  
You will also be asked to provide a process description highlighting your 
visualizations and interactions used to arrive at your conclusions. Please see 
the task description page on the Challenge website.

For the Grand Challenge, you are asked to integrate the analysis results of the 
3 Mini Challenges to provide insight to the overall situation and to prepare a 
debrief document describing the situation, providing the “who, what, when, where
and why” according to your analysis.
